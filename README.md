NFL Videos Redirect
=================
A simple app that captures android intents to open up `www.nfl.com/videos/*` and redirects to the raw mp4 file so it can be played in the default video player rather than the Verizon NFL app.

Download the apk <a href="https://github.com/dkutilek/NFLVideosRedirect/blob/master/NFLVideosRedirect.apk?raw=true">here</a>.
