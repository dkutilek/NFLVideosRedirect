NFL Videos Redirect
=================
A simple app that captures android intents to open up `www.nfl.com/videos/*` and redirects to the raw mp4 file so it can be played in the default video player rather than the Verizon NFL app.  It also handles videos from all of the 32 teams' websites.

Download the apk <a href="https://github.com/dkutilek/NFLVideosRedirect/blob/master/NFLVideosRedirect.apk?raw=true">here</a>.
